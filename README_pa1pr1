README for pa1pr1

I design this part by making connecting between server and user using input_stream and output_stream. For the Server, I use input_stream to take information from the user who types his or her message, and use output_stream to send out serverâ€™s response. If I want to print message locally, I just use system.out.println statement. It is quite same for the user as well. Conversely, the user gets response from serve by input_stream, sends out message by output_stream.
