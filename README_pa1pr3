README for pa1pr3

This part is quite same as part 2. The only thing needs to take good care is friend request. First, creating a request array to store friend request and creating a friend array to store each user's friend name. @join from user -> #Welcome from server -> welcome message printed on user's screen. @connect from user -> protocol #friendme from user to server -> protocol #friendme from server to the user who is requested -> message print out aske if user wants to add friendship -> @friends from user requested to server if she wants to add friend -> protocol #friends to server -> protocol #OKfriends from server to user -> print out sentence on user. If you want to unfriend or deny friendship, the process is same just changing the protocol. The friend array is to store friends' names if they are already friends. We need to check for friendship, if they are friends now, message is sending to or from each other, otherwise, message cannot be passed by server. If a user wants to leave, typing @Exit, sending protocol #Bye to server, receiving protocol #Bye from server, printing message on user screen.
